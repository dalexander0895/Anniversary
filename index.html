         "I've Loved these Past 2 With You"<br><br>
          They say time flies when you’re having fun, this is especially true when you’re with someone that makes you feel like you won.<br><br>
          These 2 years have felt so natural that it’s hard to believe that it’s been that long. You continue to inspire me, teach me, love me, despite all of the times that I have been wrong. <br><br>

You have been my peace and safe space for these past 2, and all I can think about is what I can give back to you. What can I give to someone who already holds great beauty. Someone whose intellect and drive allows them to always accomplish their duty. <br><br>

Someone whose spiritual growth is infectious. Someone you always enjoy being around and they never make you feel neglected. I love joking with you, learning with you, and I even love when we’re at odds. Because we are able to listen to one another and show grace which is what we were told to do by God. <br><br>

I love to see you smile, and I hate to see you sad. Im ok with seeing you angry because Ill bother you til you’re mad. You always forgive me and smile it away, I am so blessed because I’ll get to see that smile again today. <br><br>

This has been a difficult year for me in all aspects of life. Ive struggled mentally, emotionally, and even physically due to the amount of strife. I know I have neglected you in more ways than I can think. Yet there you are holding me close while I am and the brink. Ive cried on my own many nights and I never wanted to share. Because your heart and empathy are so big that I figured that would be too much for me to force you to bear. <br><br>

I guess this was my way of trying to be strong, but that doesn’t mean I wasn’t leaning on you all along. I know I can be vulnerable with you and you won’t judge, I can speak my true thoughts and you won’t hold a grudge. <br><br>

There are days that I can’t believe you exist, but this just goes to show that my prayers were answered and God granted my wish. <br><br>

Happy 2 years baby! The time spent with you has been great! I don’t know what else the Lord has in store for us, but honestly I can’t wait!<br><br>

Love, <br><br>

- Desmond (Dez)
